Here is a description of what the setup.sh does. It only run *npm install* in every folder that requires it( that have a *package.json*) in it and install protractor and selinium server globally(npm install -g protractor) to run e2e tests.

to run the setup script do :

* `chmod u+x setup.sh`
* `./setup.sh`

Any problem report it on facebook so I can improve this script.

Thanks :D

Doei!
